A real-time resource management & scheduling application to streamline the coordination of **equipment, supplies, workers,** and **scheduling for customer requests.**

#### Background

We developed an Artisan Management System designed to streamline the process of connecting customers with skilled artisans across a variety of services. Whether itâ€™s garden care, indoor and outdoor tile installation, or carpet cleaning, our platform allows customers to easily request and manage services while ensuring supervisors and workers can efficiently coordinate resources and schedules.

The project was built with Next.js and React.js on the frontend, ensuring a fast and responsive user experience. The backend API leverages vanilla JavaScript alongside React.js to handle service requests, job allocations, and notifications. For data management, we utilize a MySQL database to store and track customer requests, job details, and resource availability. 

#### Solution

Customers can easily browse through a variety of available services and request the one that suits their needs. Once a request is submitted, supervisors are notified and can accept the service request. The supervisor then conducts an on-site inspection, providing an estimated quotation for the job. After the inspection, the necessary resources and workers are allocated, and the customer is able to schedule a convenient time for the job to be completed. Once the scheduled time arrives, the assigned workers carry out the task, documenting the completed work by taking images, which are then sent to the supervisor for approval. Once the job is verified, the remaining payments are processed, and the job is marked as complete.

### Chicken Timetable Generator

#### Background

A poultry farm faced significant challenges in organizing and tracking the administration of medicines and feed for their chickens, leading to frequent errors. Without a reliable system, farm workers often struggled to determine the correct schedule for administering medicines, such as antibiotics or vaccines, at specific growth stages. This confusion sometimes resulted in chickens receiving the wrong medication or none at all, increasing the risk of disease outbreaks. Additionally, mismatched timing between feed types and medication left some flocks undernourished or exposed to adverse drug reactions. These missteps not only affected the chickens' health and growth but also posed compliance issues with food safety regulations, jeopardizing the farm's reputation and profitability. The lack of streamlined planning underscored the urgent need for a systematic approach to managing poultry care.

#### Solution

To solve the poultry farm's organizational challenges, I developed a timetable generator tailored to their specific needs. This tool allowed the farm to create clear, structured schedules for administering medicines and distributing the appropriate feed at various stages of the chickens' growth. By referencing this generator, staff could easily follow a systematic plan, eliminating guesswork and reducing the risk of errors. The solution streamlined communication between staff and management, ensuring everyone was aligned with the schedule. As a result, the farm experienced fewer mishaps, healthier chickens, and improved overall operations.

### Interactive Card Form

I developed an interactive application that enhances user experience by dynamically reflecting the account number on a card displayed in the hero image as the user types it into the form. This real-time visual feedback provides immediate confirmation of the input, creating a more engaging and intuitive interface. To ensure the accuracy and reliability of the data, I implemented comprehensive form validation for the account details. The validation checks included verifying the format, length, and character restrictions of the account number, ensuring the data was correct before submission. This approach streamlined the process, minimized user errors, and improved the overall functionality of the application.
