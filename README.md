A real-time resource management & scheduling application to streamline the coordination of **equipment, supplies, workers,** and **scheduling for customer requests.**

#### Background

We developed an Artisan Management System designed to streamline the process of connecting customers with skilled artisans across a variety of services. Whether itâ€™s garden care, indoor and outdoor tile installation, or carpet cleaning, our platform allows customers to easily request and manage services while ensuring supervisors and workers can efficiently coordinate resources and schedules.

The project was built with Next.js and React.js on the frontend, ensuring a fast and responsive user experience. The backend API leverages vanilla JavaScript alongside React.js to handle service requests, job allocations, and notifications. For data management, we utilize a MySQL database to store and track customer requests, job details, and resource availability. 

#### Solution

Customers can easily browse through a variety of available services and request the one that suits their needs. Once a request is submitted, supervisors are notified and can accept the service request. The supervisor then conducts an on-site inspection, providing an estimated quotation for the job. After the inspection, the necessary resources and workers are allocated, and the customer is able to schedule a convenient time for the job to be completed. Once the scheduled time arrives, the assigned workers carry out the task, documenting the completed work by taking images, which are then sent to the supervisor for approval. Once the job is verified, the remaining payments are processed, and the job is marked as complete.
